Clone this repository to your local machine using ``` git clone https://github.com/ravanpreet-kaur/unstarve.git ```
Navigate to the backend directory using ```cd backend ```
Install the necessary dependencies using ```npm install```
Copy the .env.example file to a new file called .env and fill in the required environment variables
Start the server using npm start
Note: Make sure you have Node and NPM installed on your machine before proceeding with the installation.
